# Making Horiseon Semantic and Efficient

## Description

This project was to make an older webpage more modern by making the HTML more semantic, so that it is more accessable. Another purpose was to make the CSS more efficient by removing redundant classes, IDs, etc. By doing this project, I have become more familiar with how to make cleaner, more DRY HTML/CSS, and to be as semantic as possible.

## Usage

This application can be used to view the homepage of Horiseon, but also to review what I've learned about semantic HTML, and efficient, DRY code.
